# It's Wordle, but smaller

[Play Now!](https://www.ianwhite.app)

React JS app for four letter Wordle. 

Changing word size, more game modes, and daily user tracking coming soon. 

#### Thoughts

Right now, the game allows you to guess anything, even words that aren't in the english language. This will get fixed, I'm just not there yet.
With the randomness of trying to guess four letter words though, it might help the player to have more freedom to test for certain letters. 
I may increase their number of guesses allowed or alter the rules of the game, give letter hints, or something like that to make it work better
for the 4 letter words. I'm sure there's some combinatorial math to do to figure out what players' odds are based on the word length. From there I'll
decide how many guesses they should get and which hints, if any, they deserve.

The flyout is currently disabled. It will return, soon...
